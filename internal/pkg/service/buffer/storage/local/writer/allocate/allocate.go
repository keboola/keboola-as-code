// Package allocate provides allocation of a free disk space for a file.
// Allocation is realized using the UNIX syscall "fallocate" (POSIX syscall "fallocate" doesn't support FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE).
//
// On systems other than Unix, this is implemented as no operation.
//
// Pre-allocation of free space causes the file to be one continuous block on the disk.
//
// It is crucial for the performance of HDD disks, where random access is slow (the read head must be moved).
// Even with SSD disks, this approach can bring some speed improvements, depending on the disk driver.
// Reading a continuous block during upload should be faster.
// Zero copy "sendfile" syscall is used for upload, so the data flows directly from the disk to the network.
