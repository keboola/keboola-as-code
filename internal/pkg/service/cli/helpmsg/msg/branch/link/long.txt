Link the current git branch to a Keboola development branch.

By default, creates a new Keboola branch with the same name as the git branch
and links it. If a Keboola branch with the same name already exists, links to it.

Cannot be used on the default branch (main/master) - it is auto-linked during init.

Examples:
  kbc branch link                     Create and link Keboola branch with git branch name
  kbc branch link --branch-id=12345   Link to existing Keboola branch by ID
  kbc branch link --branch-name=dev   Link to or create branch named "dev"
