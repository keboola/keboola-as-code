Export project data to an AI-optimized "twin format" directory structure.

The twin format is designed for AI assistants to understand and work with
Keboola projects directly from Git repositories. It includes:

  - Bucket and table metadata with schema information
  - Transformation configurations with platform detection
  - Component configurations organized by type
  - Job execution history and statistics
  - Lineage graph showing data flow dependencies
  - Optional data samples (controlled by flags)

The export creates a "twin_format/" directory containing JSON files with
inline documentation (_comment, _purpose, _update_frequency fields).

Security features:
  - Automatic detection of public Git repositories
  - Sample export disabled by default for public repos
  - Secrets (fields starting with #) are encrypted

Use "kbc llm init" first to initialize the project directory.
