Command "local fix-paths"

Manifest file ".keboola/manifest.json" contains a naming for all local paths.

With this command you can rename all existing paths
to match the configured naming (eg. if the naming has been changed).

Use "--cleanup" to remove conflicting destination paths and retry renames when necessary.
