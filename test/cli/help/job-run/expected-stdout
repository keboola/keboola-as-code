Command "remote job run"

Run one or multiple jobs. The command will wait until all of
the jobs are done, regardless of whether or not they are successful.
Jobs may be run asynchronously, in which case the command will only
wait until all the jobs have been started.
Terminating the command early does not cause the jobs to stop.
