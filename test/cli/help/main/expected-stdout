Keboola CLI is a set of commands
for operating your cloud data pipeline.

The whole Keboola project is represented
by a local directory structure.

Project can be synchronized in both
directions: Keboola project <-> local directory.

Start by running the "kbc init" in a new empty directory.
Your project will be pulled, and you can start working.
