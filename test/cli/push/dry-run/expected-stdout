  * B bar | changed: description
  * C bar/extractor/ex-generic-v2/empty | changed: name
  * C bar/transformation/keboola.python-transformation-v2/python-transformation | changed: configuration
  × C main/extractor/ex-generic-v2/empty - SKIPPED
Skipped remote objects deletion, use "--force" to delete them.
Dry run, nothing changed.
